## Business Challenge I | Team Assignment Grade: 88/100
### Professor Comment:
Thank you for submitting your assignment. Below, you will find detailed feedback highlighting the strengths of your work as well as areas for potential improvement. This feedback is intended to support your learning and enhance the quality of your future projects:

Reaching out to the client could have been more proactive with more questions around the actual prototype, it's state and why not all pages are accessible
Great introduction slide for introducing the challenge
The average login frequency shows that non-churners show a higher login frequency (monthly) compared to the churners (Slide 7)
Slide9 Message that filing claims increases churn slightly not fully value adding, while the coefficient shows 0.0
The overall analysis is very extensive, I would highly recommend to run an EDA first before running regressions or any predictive modeling, it better helps to uncover patterns, relationships
Storyline has a little transition gap from the challenges identified to the recommendations
Recommendations and strategy well connected to the CX of the prototype

### Assignment Instructions:
In this Business Challenge, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) introduces a current and very relevant client case in the insurance sector. The case focuses on customer churn, identifying patterns in data and developing strategies to mitigate churn. BCG provides a comprehensive dataset and a prototype of an insurance mobile application, offering insights into policy management, the user interface (UI), and information architecture (IA).

Assignment Objectives

The assignment combines data analysis with customer experience (CX) strategy, simulating the intersection of analytical insights and product development. It is divided into three key parts:

 

Client Engagement

You will engage as consultants, practicing client-focused skills:

• Asking critical questions to clarify the problem and context

• Exploring challenges and limitations within the scope

• Understanding the application’s use case and business objectives

 

Data Analysis

You will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights related to churn:

• Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis

• Identify churn-related patterns in the dataset (e.g., Net Promoter Score (NPS) differences between churn and non-churn groups etc.)

• Cluster customers based on behavioral data

• Highlight key features influencing churn

 

Strategy Development

Based on the data analysis, students will develop actionable strategies:

•Define key personas or behavioral archetypes that align with churn patterns

•Propose a comprehensive churn reduction strategy, considering both data insights and CX improvements

•Suggest enhancements to the current app prototype, including beyond-the-prototype CX ideas

•Develop intervention strategies to re-engage users who have already churned

 

Construct and deliver a 10-minute presentation, followed by a 5-minute Q&A, to the client, in-class, on Friday 20th December. Answer at least one of the questions that the client provided.
